## Final project for my Scripting &amp; Programming course


This was a final project for an introductory programming course. The competencies were as follows:

- The graduate applies pointers to solve problems.
- The graduate writes code that implements decision and loop constructs to control the flow of a program.
- The graduate prepares code which declares, initializes, and assigns values to variables of appropriate types as part of the application development process.
- The graduate applies object-oriented programming concepts in order to create a basic application.
- The graduate creates arrays in order to solve complex problems.
- The graduate writes code that creates and manipulates functions and files.
- The graduate applies fundamental programming concepts in a specific programming environment.
